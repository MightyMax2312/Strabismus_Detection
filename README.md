# Strabismus Detection using Deep Learning

This project contains a deep learning pipeline to detect **strabismus** (eye misalignment) from images using a trained neural network. It includes a dataset, preprocessing pipeline, training code and an h5 model with ready deployment on a Jetson Nano/Windows with potential input from an ESP32-CAM. The accuracy of the model is 77%, and has the following features:-
- CNN-based model to detect strabismus from eye images
- Dataset and preprocessing pipeline included
- Training scripts and a pretrained `.h5` model
- Docker support for deployment
- Designed to run on:
  - **Jetson Nano**
  - **Windows**
  - Linux systems
  - Potential ESP32-CAM input
